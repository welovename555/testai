# Testai Web Game

This repository contains a simple web-based tic-tac-toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is designed as a small project to demonstrate web development and game logic.

## How to Play

Open `index.html` in a web browser and click the cells in the 3×3 grid to place your mark. Player X goes first, and players take turns until one player gets three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) or the grid is full (draw). The game will display a message when someone wins or the game ends in a draw. You can reset the game by clicking the "Restart" button.

## Files

- `index.html` – main HTML file with the game layout
- `style.css` – CSS file with basic styles
- `script.js` – JavaScript logic for the game

Enjoy playing!
